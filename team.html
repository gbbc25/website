        <p>Michael & Suzanne</p>
          <p>My name is Michael Lawrence, and I’m married to Suzanne. I was born in Burnley, Lancashire. I’ve lived in
              Great Blakenham since January 2014. We have 4 children: Natalie, Tim, Aimee and Benjamin.</p>

          <p>I was brought up in a Christian home with two brothers and two sisters. I knew all about Jesus from going
              to church and children’s clubs. At the age of 7 I asked Jesus to be my Saviour. I have been involved with
              WEC Camps since the age of 18, which are Christian Camps for 9-17 year olds with an emphasis on World
              Mission. These have been some of the best holidays I have had, making lots of friends and eventually
              serving with WEC International, in the Youth Office, full time for 10 years before moving to Suffolk.</p>

          <p>My hobbies include following Burnley FC, playing games, Chess and watching sports.</p>

        <p>Luke & Anna</p>
        <p>
          Born and bred in Suffolk, we met at Mickfield Evangelical Church and got married in 2009.
          We were part of the church rejuvenation team that joined gbbc in 2012. Our daughter was 9 months old
          and she was the only child in the church at the time. It's wonderful to see how God has blessed the
          church with lots more children since then. We are passionate about sharing the good news of Jesus
          which we have had opportunity to do through our children's club every Friday evening. We also have a son,
          Eddie, a labrador called Ron and a cocker spaniel called Gertie!

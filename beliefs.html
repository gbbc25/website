    <h1 class="heading-styling">What we believe</h1>
	<section id="statement-of-beliefs">
		<h2>God</h2>
		<p class="statement">There is one God, who exists eternally as three distinct but co-equal persons: the Father,
			the Son, and the Holy Spirit, each having the whole divine essence, yet the essence is undivided. God is
			unchangeable in His holiness, justice, wisdom and love. He is the almighty Creator, Saviour and Judge who
			sustains and governs all things according to His sovereign will for His own glory.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Gen 1:1; Deut.6:4; Deut. 32:4; Jer. 10:10; Mal 3:6; Mt. 3:16-17; Mt. 28:19; Acts 17:24; 1 Cor. 8:4; 2 Cor
			13:14; Tit. 3:4-5; Rev 4:11; Rev 15:4)</p>

		<h2>The Bible</h2>
		<p>God in His great goodness has revealed all that is necessary to life and salvation in the Bible, which
			consists of the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments alone. Every word was inspired by God through human
			authors, so that the Bible as originally given is, in its entirety, the Word of God, without error and fully
			reliable in fact and doctrine. The Bible alone speaks with final authority and is always sufficient for all
			matters of belief and practice. The infallible rule of interpretation of the Bible is the Bible itself.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Rom 15:4; 1 Thess.2:13; 2 Tim. 3:15-17; 2 Peter 1:19-21)</p>

		<h2>Original sin</h2>
		<p>God made our first father Adam perfect, holy and upright. Adam sinned and as the representative and head of
			the human race brought upon himself and all his offspring death, condemnation and a sinful nature. As a
			result it is utterly beyond the power of fallen mankind to have a saving knowledge of God, to love God, to
			keep his laws, to believe the Gospel, to repent of sin or trust in Christ.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Gen 1:27 &31; Gen.2:15-17; Gen 3:6; Ps 51:5; Jn.8:34-35; Rom.3:10-20; 1 Cor. 15:22)
		</p>

		<h2>Election</h2>
		<p>God, before the foundation of the world, and for His own glory elected to eternal life a number of persons
			which no one can count, as an act of free and sovereign grace. This election was in no way dependent upon
			His foresight of human faith, decision, works or merit.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Jn.17:1-3; Rom.9:11-16; Eph.1:4-5; 1 Pet.1:1-2; 1 Pet.2:9-10)</p>

		<h2>Jesus Christ</h2>
		<p>God sent forth His Son, who is God from all eternity, who became man, Jesus Christ our Lord, fully God and
			fully man, having two natures, but one person. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, yet
			without sin, and lived a sinless life in obedience to the Father. He taught with authority and all His words
			are true. On the cross He died in the place of sinners, bearing God's punishment for their sin, and
			redeeming them by his blood. He rose from the dead and in His resurrection body ascended into heaven where
			He is exalted as Lord of all. He intercedes for His people in the presence of the Father.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Mt.7:28-29; Lk.1:35; Jn.1:1-4 & 14; Acts 1:9-11; Rom. 9.5; 1 Cor.15:3-8; 2 Cor. 5:21;
			Phil.2:9-11; Heb.7:25-26; 1 Pet.1:18-19)</p>

		<h2>Particular redemption</h2>
		<p>The Lord Jesus Christ died at Calvary to effect atonement, propitiation, reconciliation and redemption for
			His elect people.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Jn.10:11; Acts 20:28; Rom.3:24-26; Eph.1:3-7; Eph.5.25; 2 Tim.1:9)</p>

		<h2>Justification</h2>
		<p>God bore testimony to His acceptance of His Son's work by raising Him from the dead. Therefore all who are
			called by grace are justified in the sight of God on account of the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ,
			which is received by faith alone.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Acts 13:38-39; Rom.3:24; Rom.4:24-25; Rom.5:1 7 18)</p>

		<h2>The Holy Spirit and Regeneration</h2>
		<p>The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son and is sent forth into the world to glorify Christ and
			to apply His work of salvation. Through His all-powerful work those dead in sin are brought into spiritual
			life. They hear the call of God through His Word and are given the desire and ability to repent of sin and
			believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Saviour and Lord. The Holy Spirit indwells all believers, brings
			assurance of salvation and produces increasing likeness to Christ. He builds up the church and empowers its
			members for worship, service and mission.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Jn.14:26; Jn.15:26; Rom.8:30; Eph.1:13-14; Jam.1:18; 1 Pet.1:23)</p>

		<h2>Holy living</h2>
		<p>In obedience to God's Word and will, and out of love for our Lord Jesus Christ a Christian is called to live
			a holy life. It is only such a holy life that gives evidence of true faith and regeneration.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Jn.14:15; Rom.6:22; 1 Cor.6:9-11; 1 Thess.4:7; Heb 12:14; 1 Pet. 1:15-16)</p>

		<h2>The Local Church</h2>
		<p>The Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the local church and has appointed pastors/teachers/elders whose
			calling is recognized by the Church membership. The task of those so appointed is to lead, oversee, teach,
			encourage and equip His people that they in love and unity might serve Him. The Unity of the body of Christ
			is expressed within and between churches by mutual love, care and encouragement. True fellowship between
			churches exists only where they are faithful to the Word of God.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Acts 2.42; Acts 13:1-4; Eph.1:22-23; Eph.4:11-12; 2 Thess.3:6; 1 Tim. 5.17, 2 Tim.1:9;
			Heb.13:7 & 17; Rev 2-3)</p>

		<h2>Baptism and the Lord's Supper</h2>
		<p>Baptism and the Lord's Supper are ordinances given by the Lord Jesus Christ as visible signs of the Gospel
			and of union with Christ and His Church. In baptism (i.e. immersion), the believer declares their repentance
			and faith and this is necessary in order to enter membership of the local church and partake of the Lord's
			Supper, which is administered under the discipline of that local church.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Mt.3:16; Mt.28:19-20; Jn.3:22-23; Acts 2:38 &41-42; Acts 8:12; Acts 8:18;
			1 Cor. 11:23-26)</p>

		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>The responsibility and privilege of the local church is to be obedient to Christ's Commission to go into all
			the world and preach the gospel to all mankind, to make disciples, baptising and teaching them.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Mt 28:19-20; Mk.16:15; Acts 1:8; Acts 13:1-4; Rom.1:14-16; 1 Thess.1:8;
			1 Thess 2:4)</p>

		<h2>Final perseverance</h2>
		<p>Those who are regenerated, called and justified shall, by the grace and power of God persevere in holiness
			and enter into the joys of heaven.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Rom.8:28-30 &38-39; PhiI.1:6; 1 Pet.1:3-5; Jude 24)</p>

		<h2>Second Coming</h2>
		<p>The Lord Jesus Christ will return personally, bodily and visibly as He promised.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Mt.24:30; Jn.14:1-3; Acts 1:9-11; 1 Thess.4:16; Rev.1:7)</p>

		<h2>Final judgement</h2>
		<p>When the Lord Jesus Christ returns in glory he will raise the dead and judge the world in righteousness. The
			wicked will be sent to eternal punishment and the righteous will be welcomed into a life of eternal joy in
			fellowship with God. God will make all things new and will be glorified forever.</p>
		<p class="verse-styling">(Mt.25:31-32 & 46; Acts 17:31; 1 Thess.4:16-17; 2 Thess 1:6-10; 2 Pet. 3:10;
			Rev 14:11)</p>

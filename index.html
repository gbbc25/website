						Our <b>Sunday Morning service</b> is held on Chapel Lane in Great Blakenham at 10.45am every 
						Sunday, where you can expect a warm welcome, Bible-based teaching, Sunday
						School & Creche. The Gospel is central and our services include reading the Bible, 
						praying, worshipping God through song, and a sermon. Please join us for refreshments after the service.
						<br><br>
						We also have an <b>all-age-service</b> usually on the 3rd Sunday morning of the month - there is no Sunday school or 
						organised crèche as the children stay in for the whole service. This usually includes a 
						quiz, memory verse & interactive story.
						<br><br>
						We usually have <b>communion</b> on the first Sunday of the month (this takes place during the morning service). We welcome 
						all who have trusted the Lord as their own personal saviour to our Communion meeting. It is a simple service of remembrance
						of what Jesus did for us by dying for us on the cross and being raised to life again the third day.
						<br><br>
						We have an <b>evening Service</b> we meet at Mickfield Evangelical Church at 6.30pm. For directions, see <a href="#mickfield-evening-service-box" id="special-link">above</a>. 
						All are very welcome to join us. For more information, visit their website at <a href="https://mickfieldec.co.uk/" target="_blank">https://mickfieldec.co.uk/</a>.

								My name is Michael Lawrence, and I’m married to Suzanne. I was born in Burnley, Lancashire. I’ve lived in
								Great Blakenham since January 2014. We have 4 children: Natalie, Tim, Aimee and Benjamin.
								<br><br>
								I was brought up in a Christian home with two brothers and two sisters. I knew all about Jesus from going
								to church and children’s clubs. At the age of 7 I asked Jesus to be my Saviour. I have been involved with
								WEC Camps since the age of 18, which are Christian Camps for 9-17 year olds with an emphasis on World
								Mission. These have been some of the best holidays I have had, making lots of friends and eventually
								serving with WEC International, in the Youth Office, full time for 10 years before moving to Suffolk.
								<br><br>
								My hobbies include following Burnley FC, playing games, Chess and watching sports.

								Born and bred in Suffolk, we met at Mickfield Evangelical Church and got married in 2009.
								We were part of the church rejuvenation team that joined gbbc in 2012. Our daughter was 9 months old

								church with lots more children since then. We are passionate about sharing the good news of Jesus
								which we have had opportunity to do through our children's club every Friday evening. We also have a son,
								Eddie, a labrador called Ron and a cocker spaniel called Gertie!
